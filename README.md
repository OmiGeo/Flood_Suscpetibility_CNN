# Flood_Suscpetibility_CNN
The project's study area is located in Kottayam district, Kerala state, India. The first stage involved creating a flood inventory by processing SAR satellite images using Google Earth Engine. The inventorying process considered a total of 17 flood conditioning parameters, including rainfall, soil, geology, geomorphology, aspect, elevation, TWI, STI, SPI, slope, curvature, LULC, NDVI, drainage density, distance from river, curve number, and flow accumulation. These parameters were preprocessed, converted into a raster image format, and clipped into a 13*13 pixel size image for training locations, using the flood inventory. The images were then labeled into flooded and non-flooded classes, and a CNN model was developed.
The performance of the CNN model was compared with that of traditional machine learning models, such as XGBOOST and SVM. The models were evaluated using accuracy, specificity, recall, precision, and AUC-ROC curve.
